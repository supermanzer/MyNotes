_Capturing ongoing notes regarding software architecture and design of the NDBC Python package_

---
To assist in defining the design I wish to achieve, I will be following the book [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/architecture-patterns-with/9781492052197/).  I will skip that parts I do not feel apply but this is the reference I will be using to sketch out the design of this package in terms of commonly used design patterns and software architecture.
