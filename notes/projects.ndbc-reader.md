As with the [[Local Library|locallibrary]] project, these notes are being added only after the project's complexity has reached a point where I feel the need to jot things down in order to keep track of everything in my head.  Additionally, even though these are notes to myself about my own software projects, I still write as if I'm explaining these ideas to someone else.  It's a habit I picked up when I started coding in grad school and, since it works for me, I do not feel any need to change. Alright, on to the confusing bits!
