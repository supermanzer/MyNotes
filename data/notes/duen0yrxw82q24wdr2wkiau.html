<p>I now have a configured a <code>DarkMode</code> switcher that hooks into the global <code>$vuetify.theme.isDark</code> property.  This allows me to toggle Dark mode on/off.  However there are some scenarios that I am running into where working with a global <code>dark: true|false</code> is proving difficult.</p>
<h3 id="nav-headers"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#nav-headers"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Nav Headers</h3>
<p>While the general light/dark mode makes sense in most situations, on pages where I have large hero images with a darkening gradient overlay I will need a way to enforce <code>dark: true</code> without actually changing this setting.  CHanging the setting would require a user to reset this value every time they navigate to a page that requires dark mode and then to another page. </p>
<p>After typing this it becomes clear that the best option here would be to use a <code>darkMode</code> prop for the <code>NavHeader</code> component that defaults to <code>false</code>.  Then I would create a computed property that determines the styling applied to all text in the NavBar by the following formula: </p>
<pre><code>  this.darkMode || this.$vuetify.theme.isDark
</code></pre>
<p>Then, when loading any page that uses a <code>layout</code> that requires specific styling regardless of the selected theme mode, I can simply pass the prop of <code>:darkMode="true"</code>.</p>

<p>At earlier stages of development I wrote style rules directly on various components.  While this makes it easier for me to rapidly adjust styling and get a feel for how different styles look, if left in place it makes changing overall styles a huge <a href="https://www.netlingo.com/word/pita.php#:~:text=Pain%20In%20The%20Ass,jargon%20or%20text%20message%20shorthand">PITA</a>. So now, as the stylistic focus of my site shifts to defining cohesive global styles, my focus will be on those components with hard-coded styles and how I can use Vue's <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style.html">Class and Style Bindings</a> to achieve some component specific styles while still adhering to a global style approach that is responsive to a user's selection of Light or Dark mode.</p>
