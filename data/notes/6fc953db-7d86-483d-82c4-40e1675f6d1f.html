<p>These notes are being added only after the project's complexity has reached a point where I feel the need to jot things down in order to keep track of everything in my head.  Additionally, even though these are notes to myself about my own software projects, I still write as if I'm explaining these ideas to someone else.  It's a habit I picked up when I started coding in grad school and, since it works for me, I do not feel any need to change. Alright, on to the confusing bits!</p>

<p>I worry going all in on a modular approach is introducing unnecessary complexity. I still think the separation of concerns achieved by splitting out the functionality into separate classes with well defined scopes is a net positive. To try and achieve this without unnecessary complexity I will start by documenting how I plan to organize the files in the <code>/src/NDBC</code> directory for this package.</p>

<li><code>repository.py</code> - This file defines the classes/methods used to save and load the state of a particular instance of an NDBC data station.  It will encapsulate different methods for different approaches to data storage such as text files (<code>.json</code>, <code>.csv</code>) or SQL/NoSQL DBs.</li>

<p>This project has been neglected since I changed jobs and have had to spend more of my free time learning different programming languages and paradigms in order to keep up.  However that comes with a bonus of exposure to more enterprise grade software architecture.  With that in mind I plan to make a more rigorous effort to use a more design pattern driven approach to the NDBC Reader package.  </p>
<p>What follows is a first draft of the patterns and approaches I think would make sense to employ in this effort.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Store/Data Transfer Object:</strong> This is a more codified approach to storing the various elemets of the data that the NDBC Reader project is the focus of.  This will also encapsulate saving a Data Buoy object to disk and re-instantiating from saved data.</li>
<li><strong>Repository:</strong> The repository pattern encapsulates the logic required to create, delete, and update the data.  </li>
<li><strong>API Services:</strong> These services will encapsulate the logic required to make specific API requests.  </li>
<li><strong>Analysis Service:</strong> This will encapsulate the rudimentary analyses that will be added to the NDBC Reader package and the Data Buoy class.</li>
<li><strong>Unit of Work:</strong> This will abstract the communication between the API services (fetching data) and the repository (storing data).</li>
</ul>

<p>As a way to facilitate better package organization, testing, and documentation, I want to refresh the package using <a href="https://pyscaffold.org/en/stable/index.html">PyScallfold</a>.  This should allow me to revise how the NDBC DataBuoy package is organized and contributed to in a much more rigorous fashion without too much effort on my part.</p>

<p>I had previously begun documenting how to split responsibilities into two separate classes.  After consideration I have decided this was a half-hearted attempt at modularity and I would be better served by following a more rigorous approach to design principles.  These docs have been removed.</p>
