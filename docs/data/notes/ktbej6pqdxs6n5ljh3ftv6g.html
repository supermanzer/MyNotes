<p><em>This section is intended to capture design decisions for a potential Android application as part of the Recipes Server</em></p>
<hr>
<p>One of the important choices to make is how much data to store locally, if at all.  The book I am working through to build Android apps is making use of the <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room">Room API</a> to perform CRUD operations with an SQLite DB saved locally on the Android device's file system.  This makes me start to question an entirely API reliant design.</p>

<p>My question for this app is whether it would make more sense to use the local server just for performing the <a href="/MyNotes/notes/Wl7xkoMZgCm0faeX2LfZn">Text Parsing</a> and <a href="/MyNotes/notes/HsYAro3Jb3QOLVgLdGOK3">Text Assigment</a> functionality and store the final recipe record
locally or whether I should rely on the REST API entirely.  While this would simplify application design it would mean the apps functionality would entirely depend on the health and availability of a Raspberry Pi runningon my local network</p>

<ul>
<li>Proceed with entirely REST API driven approach </li>
<li>Be prepared to transition to more data storage in the Android device itself as I become more familiar with caching and synchronizing local data with the canonical server database.</li>
</ul>
