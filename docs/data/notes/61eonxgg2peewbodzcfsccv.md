Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the segmentation, tokenization, and recognition of text into meaning.  This approach is what will be used to classify portions of the recipe into Ingredients and Steps.

* **Ingredients:** Usually short sentence fragments that include ingredients and amounts.  In some cases they wil also include adverbs.

* **Steps:** Longer, mostly full, sentences that are often directions of what to do and contain verbs pertaining to the ingredients.

The topic of NLP is quite broad and I think my next steps will need to include working through some general tutorials as well as some more focused on identifying the components outlined above.
