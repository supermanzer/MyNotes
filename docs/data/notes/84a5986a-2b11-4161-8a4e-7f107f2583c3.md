The user interface for library patrons is built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) using an entirely static (JAMstack) approach. This is the most unfamiliar technology in the stack for me and the area of the steepest learning curve. Working on this pet project has given me enough understanding to begin to use this technology in my professional work.
