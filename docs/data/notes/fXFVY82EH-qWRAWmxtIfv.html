<p>Since this aspect of the application will utililze both front and back-end features, I'm not splitting it out into either the Models or Nuxt sections.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-notifications"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#types-of-notifications"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Types of Notifications</h2>
<p>Let's think through the kinds of notifications we would want to send a user and where in their experience with the application this would take place.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-api-design"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#a-note-on-api-design"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>A Note on API Design</h3>
<p>Since both of these kinds of information represent user-specific data, I think we shoud nest the routes for retrieving all of this data within the general <code>user/:id/</code> endpoint.  This is a good place to use the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#marking-extra-actions-for-routing"><code>@action</code> decorators for Django-REST-Framework viewsets</a></p>
<h3 id="late-fees"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#late-fees"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Late Fees</h3>
<p>Less than fun for the user, this notification would alert a user of the total amount of fees owed to the library.  Now what do we need to make this happen?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home page</strong>: This should be presented to the user under our banner on the home page.  We will want a component that makes a request to the API and, if the fees returned are greater than 0. display a warning.  Right now I think this should just have a link to the user's profile page since the intent of that page is to handle all user-specific features.</li>
<li><strong>Snack bar</strong>:  We want to get paid right?  So we'll put it up in their face.  This will also give me exposure to integrating more buttons on the Snack bar element besides the <code>Close</code> feature.</li>
<li><strong>Pay Fee Component</strong>:  This would be a simple form that displays each instance of a Borrowed copy for which we have an outstanding late fee and request the user to pay their fees.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>:  Rather than fecthing all the books associated witha user and performing some <code>reduce()</code> operation to get the total late fees, I think we can do this in the database.  It may not be best practice because generalized approaches are usually preferred but I'm in charge here and I say we're using the PostgreSQL server for this!  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reservations"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#reservations"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Reservations</h3>
<p>Now here's something our patrons will enjoy a bit more.  We want to notify them when a book they have reserved has been returned to circulation.  For a refresher on this workflow take a peek <a href="/MyNotes/notes/c874cfd9-6e98-431b-a86a-b60d0cbf3a69">here</a>.  Alright so how should this work?</p>
<p>I'm thinking the same snack bar/home page element approach as I would want multiple chances to encounter the notification that a book I was waiting on is available.  We don't need any mechanism to pay fees and we can re-use the checkout functionality currently available for book instances.  </p>
<p>The real question here is how to identify when this is the case for a given user's <code>BorrowedCopy</code> record.  The back end allows any number of users to create reservations for books that are not currently available.  We need to ensure we apply a FIFO strategy to these reservations <strong>and</strong> we have a way to to query our <code>BorrowedCopy</code> records by user and <em>only</em> return records that are valid for checkout.  I smell more query annotations!</p>
